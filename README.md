  ## Description:

  A Social Network API. By using Insomnia you can `POST` multiple **Users** by username and email as well as a new **Thought**. Users can `POST` other users as their **Friends** who may also `POST` their **Reaction** into thoughts. Users and thoughts can be updated `PUT` by ID. Lastly, all users, friends, thoughts and reactions can be removed by their ID `DELETE`.
